DSWaveformImage offers a few interfaces for the purpose of drawing the
envelope waveform of audio data in iOS, iPadOS and Mac Catalyst. To do so, you can use

* [`WaveformImageView`](https://github.com/dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage/blob/main/DSWaveformImage/DSWaveformImage/UIKit/WaveformImageView.swift) (UIKit) / [`WaveformView`](https://github.com/dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage/blob/main/DSWaveformImage/DSWaveformImage/SwiftUI/WaveformView.swift) (SwiftUI) to render a static waveform from an audio file or 
* [`WaveformLiveView`](https://github.com/dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage/blob/main/DSWaveformImage/DSWaveformImage/UIKit/WaveformLiveView.swift) (UIKit) / [`WaveformLiveCanvas`](https://github.com/dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage/blob/main/DSWaveformImage/DSWaveformImage/SwiftUI/WaveformLiveCanvas.swift) (SwiftUI) to realtime render a waveform of live audio data (e.g. from `AVAudioRecorder`)
* `WaveformImageDrawer` to generate a waveform `UIImage` from an audio file

Additionally, you can get a waveform's (normalized) `[Float]` samples directly as well by
creating an instance of `WaveformAnalyzer`.

Example UI (included in repository)
------------

For a practical real-world example usage of a SwiftUI live audio recording waveform rendering, see [RecordingIndicatorView](https://github.com/dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage/blob/main/DSWaveformImageExample/SwiftUIExample/RecordingIndicatorView.swift).

If you really like this library (aka Sponsoring)
------------
I'm doing all this for fun and joy and because I strongly believe in the power of open source. On the off-chance though, that using my library has brought joy to you and you just feel like saying "thank you", I would smile like a 4-year old getting a huge ice cream cone, if you'd support my via one of the sponsoring buttons ‚ò∫Ô∏èüíï

If you're feeling in the mood of sending someone else a lovely gesture of appreciation, maybe check out my iOS app [üíå SoundCard](https://www.soundcard.io) to send them a real postcard with a personal audio message.

Installation
------------

* use SPM: add `https://github.com/dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage` and set "Up to Next Major" with "10.0.0"

**Deprecated or discouraged** but still possible alternative ways for older apps:

* since it has no other dependencies you may simply copy the `DSWaveformImage` folder directly into your project
* use carthage: `github "dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage" ~> 7.0`
* or, sunset since 6.1.1: ~~use cocoapods: `pod 'DSWaveformImage', '~> 6.1'`~~

Usage
-----

`DSWaveformImage` provides 3 kinds of tools to use
* native SwiftUI views - [SwiftUI example usage code](https://github.com/dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage/blob/main/DSWaveformImageExample/SwiftUIExample/SwiftUIExampleView.swift)
* native UIKit views - [UIKit example usage code](https://github.com/dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage/blob/main/DSWaveformImageExample/ViewController.swift)
* access to the raw renderes and processors

### SwiftUI

#### `WaveformView` - renders a one-off waveform from an audio file:

```swift
@State var audioURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "example_sound", withExtension: "m4a")!
WaveformView(audioURL: $audioURL)
```

#### `WaveformLiveCanvas` - renders a live waveform from `(0...1)` normalized samples:

```swift
@StateObject private var audioRecorder: AudioRecorder = AudioRecorder() // just an example
WaveformLiveCanvas(samples: $audioRecorder.samples)
```

### UIKit

#### `WaveformImageView` - renders a one-off waveform from an audio file:

```swift
let audioURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "example_sound", withExtension: "m4a")!
waveformImageView = WaveformImageView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 500, height: 300)
waveformImageView.waveformAudioURL = audioURL
```

#### `WaveformLiveView` - renders a live waveform from `(0...1)` normalized samples:

Find a full example in the [sample project's RecordingViewController](https://github.com/dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage/blob/main/DSWaveformImageExample/RecordingViewController.swift).

```swift
let waveformView = WaveformLiveView()

// configure and start AVAudioRecorder
let recorder = AVAudioRecorder()
recorder.isMeteringEnabled = true // required to get current power levels

// after all the other recording (omitted for focus) setup, periodically (every 20ms or so):
recorder.updateMeters() // gets the current value
let currentAmplitude = 1 - pow(10, recorder.averagePower(forChannel: 0) / 20)
waveformView.add(sample: currentAmplitude)
```

### Raw API

#### Configuration

*Note:* Calculations are always performed and returned on a background thread, so make sure to return to the main thread before doing any UI work.

Check `Waveform.Configuration` in [WaveformImageTypes](./DSWaveformImage/DSWaveformImage/WaveformImageTypes.swift) for various configuration options.

#### `WaveformImageDrawer` - creates a `UIImage` waveform from an audio file:

```swift
let waveformImageDrawer = WaveformImageDrawer()
let audioURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "example_sound", withExtension: "m4a")!
waveformImageDrawer.waveformImage(fromAudioAt: audioURL, with: .init(
                                  size: topWaveformView.bounds.size,
                                  style: .filled(UIColor.black),
                                  position: .top)) { image in
    // need to jump back to main queue
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        self.topWaveformView.image = image
    }
}
```

#### `WaveformAnalyzer` - calculates an audio file's waveform sample:

```swift
let audioURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "example_sound", withExtension: "m4a")!
waveformAnalyzer = WaveformAnalyzer(audioAssetURL: audioURL)
waveformAnalyzer.samples(count: 200) { samples in
    print("so many samples: \(samples)")
}
```

### `async` / `await` Support

The public API has been updated in 9.1 to support `async` / `await`. See the example app for an illustration.

```swift
public class WaveformAnalyzer {
    func samples(count: Int, qos: DispatchQoS.QoSClass = .userInitiated) async throws -> [Float]
}

public class WaveformImageDrawer {
    public func waveformImage(
        fromAudioAt audioAssetURL: URL,
        with configuration: Waveform.Configuration,
        qos: DispatchQoS.QoSClass = .userInitiated
    ) async throws -> UIImage
}
```


### Playback Indication

If you're playing back audio files and would like to indicate the playback progress to your users, you can [find inspiration in this ticket](https://github.com/dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage/issues/21).
There's various other ways of course, depending on your use case and design. Using `WaveformLiveView` may be another one in conjunction with `AVAudioPlayer` (note that `AVPlayer` does *not* offer
the same simple access to its audio metering data, so is not as suitable out of the box).

### Loading remote audio files from URL

For one example way to display waveforms for audio files on remote URLs see https://github.com/dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage/issues/22.

What it looks like
------------------

Waveforms can be rendered in 3 different styles: `.filled`, `.gradient` and
`.striped`. 

Similarly, there are 3 positions relative to the canvas, `.top`, `.middle` and `.bottom`.

The effect of each of those can be seen here:

Migration
---------
In 9.0.0 a few public API's have been slightly changed to be more concise. All types have also been grouped under the `Waveform` enum-namespace. Meaning `WaveformConfiguration` for instance has become `Waveform.Configuration` and so on.

In 7.0.0 colors have moved into associated values on the respective `style` enum.

`Waveform` and the `UIImage` category have been removed in 6.0.0 to simplify the API.
See `Usage` for current usage.

[SoundCard - postcards with sound](https://www.soundcard.io) lets you send real, physical postcards with audio messages. Right from your iOS device.

DSWaveformImage is used to draw the waveforms of the audio messages that get printed on the postcards sent by [SoundCard - postcards with audio](https://www.soundcard.io).
